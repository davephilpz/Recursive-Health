        <h2>1. My background</h2>

        <p>
          I graduated from Pennstate University with a bachelor's of science in
          business degree and marketing concentration. I began my career at
          Prudential as an auditor for different lines of insurance and worked
          there for a number of years.
        </p>

        <p>
          I had started learning Japanese and then went to live in Japan. I was
          there for 6 months and learned a bit of the language through vigorous
          studying. I then moved back to the states and got a job at PLCG
          Insurance as a web programmer and project manager. That job lasted a
          year or so until the company was sold and merged with another
          insurance company. I took that pportunity and moved back to Japan and
          lived in Tokyo for about 5 years working first as an english teacher,
          then moving into legal consulting and then working at a city hall in
          Tokyo for the majority of the time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Upon moving back to the US, I worked as an interpreter and in R&D
          developing and omproving products etc. for Suminoe Textile for about 5
          years. When company peformance dropped, I leaned on my programming
          skills combined with a refresher and moved back to PA and landed a job
          with an e-commerce company.

        <h2>2. Why I started a health blog</h2>

        <p>
          Back in 2020 I was stuck at home a lot and also having some postural
          issues of my own I decided to start studying anything health related
          that I could get my hands on.
        </p>

        <h3>Key areas of focus for good health:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Sleep: </strong> This is time where your body repairs
            itself, your immune system builds itself up, your muscles get
            stronger and your brain organizes thought. Failing to get proper
            sleep, mainly deep sleep and REM sleep will cause
            <strong>all</strong> other areas to fail and
            <strong>cannot</strong> be ignored.

                />
                <div class="overlay-text">Improve your sleep now!</div>
              </a>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Diet: </strong> This is probably the next most important
            thing after sleep as your body is a machine and needs the
            <strong>proper</strong>fuel and building blocks in order to function
            as God intended it to. Good food is hard to come by these days and
            is the cause of <strong>most</strong> modern day Western culture
            diseases.

            <div class="image-with-overlay">
              <a href="blog/diet/diet.html">

            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stress management: </strong> When people hear stress most if
            not all only think about mental stress. <strong>All</strong> forms
            of mental stress, sickness, exercise, excessive hot/cold, low
            oxygen, lack of food, water, or electrolytes etc. are all forms of
            stress that damage the body. Lucky for us is that if we manage these
            stresses and keep them acute plus rest, the body will come back
            stronger that it was before. Failing to manage stress will lead to
            sickness and possibly disease or even death. These types of stress
            are also known as hormesis.

            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Posture: </strong> Posture is important because not being in
            proper posture for long periods of time can and
            <strong>will</strong> hinder you body from performing the way it was
            intended to. Proper posture cannot be maintained without properly
            maintaining bones, ligaments, tendons and muscles which give us our
            posture in the first place.

        <p>
          This cycle is typically repeated for three to four rounds.
          Practitioners of the method report feelings of euphoria, calm, and
          increased tolerance to cold temperatures after performing these
          breathing exercises.

        <p>
          This website is dedicated to helping people for FREE and the main
          purpose is to provide enough information as an entryway into various
          sectors of health and wellness. It is a collection of publically
          available information on health from a plethora of medical
          professionals, medical journals and personal experimentation and
          experience. Just drill down to the level of detail you are interested
          in. New content will slowly be added and old content updated if later
          new studies and experiments overturn the facts.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please also be aware that everyone has a slightly different body
          makeup and different genes that can affect how different factors
          effect your health. Even though lifestyle choices are the majority of
          health (80-90% according to some leading experts Like David Sinclair),
          genes can disallow you from performing certain activities or hinder
          your health in some ways. Some people also have pre-existing medical
          conditions all of which are most likely lifestyle illnesses and can be
          reversed. Remeber, there is always a cure and that knowing is half the
          battle!
