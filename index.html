        <h2>1. What is being healthy in the first place?</h2>

        <p>
          In my personal definition, being healthy is the ability to live your
          life to the fullest without losing performance of losing certain body
          functionality. This can mean different things to different people, but
          I would consider it not having any genetic or lifestyle diseases that
          hinder your daily life or any physical or mental activity that you
          engage in.

      <section class="blog-section" id="centerpiece-2">
        <h2>2. What areas should I focus on to get or stay healthy?</h2>

        <p>
          This section will cover key areas you can focus on the get the most
          out of your body. Remeber that your body is a machine and that a
          machine without proper fuel and building blocks
          <strong>cannot</strong> properly function. This guide is setup in a
          hierarchical format and you can use this to drill down to the details
          for the section you wish to learn more about.
        </p>

        <h3>Key areas of focus for good health:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Sleep: </strong> This is time where your body repairs
            itself, your immune system builds itself up, your muscles get
            stronger and your brain organizes thought. Failing to get proper
            sleep, mainly deep sleep and REM sleep will cause
            <strong>all</strong> other areas to fail and
            <strong>cannot</strong> be ignored.

              </a>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Diet: </strong> This is probably the next most important
            thing after sleep as your body is a machine and needs the
            <strong>proper</strong>fuel and building blocks in order to function
            as God intended it to. Good food is hard to come by these days and
            is the cause of <strong>most</strong> modern day Western culture
            diseases.

            <strong>Stress management: </strong> When people hear stress most if
            not all only think about mental stress. <strong>All</strong> forms
            of mental stress, sickness, exercise, excessive hot/cold, low
            oxygen, lack of food, water, or electrolytes etc. are all forms of
            stress that damage the body. Lucky for us is that if we manage these
            stresses and keep them acute plus rest, the body will come back
            stronger that it was before. Failing to manage stress will lead to
            sickness and possibly disease or even death. These types of stress
            are also known as hormesis.

          <li>
            <strong>Posture: </strong> Posture is important because not being in
            proper posture for long periods of time can and
            <strong>will</strong> hinder you body from performing the way it was
            intended to. Proper posture cannot be maintained without properly
            maintaining bones, ligaments, tendons and muscles which give us our
            posture in the first place.

          This cycle is typically repeated for three to four rounds.
          Practitioners of the method report feelings of euphoria, calm, and
          increased tolerance to cold temperatures after performing these
          breathing exercises.

        <p>
          This website is dedicated to helping people for FREE and the main
          purpose is to provide enough information as an entryway into various
          sectors of health and wellness. It is a collection of publically
          available information on health from a plethora of medical
          professionals, medical journals and personal experimentation and
          experience. Just drill down to the level of detail you are interested
          in. New content will slowly be added and old content updated if later
          new studies and experiments overturn the facts.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please also be aware that everyone has a slightly different body
          makeup and different genes that can affect how different factors
          effect your health. Even though lifestyle choices are the majority of
          health (80-90% according to some leading experts Like David Sinclair),
          genes can disallow you from performing certain activities or hinder
          your health in some ways. Some people also have pre-existing medical
          conditions all of which are most likely lifestyle illnesses and can be
          reversed. Remeber, there is always a cure and that knowing is half the
          battle!
