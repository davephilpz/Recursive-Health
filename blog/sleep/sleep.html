        <h2>1. Just why is sleep that important?</h2>

        <p>
          Sleep plays a crucial role in maintaining overall health and
          well-being throughout your life. Getting enough quality sleep at the
          right times can help protect your mental health, physical health,
          quality of life, and safety. Here's why sleep is so important:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Physical Health:</strong> Sleep is involved in healing and
            repair of your heart and blood vessels. Ongoing sleep deficiency is
            linked to an increased risk of heart disease, kidney disease, high
            blood pressure, diabetes, and stroke.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mental Health:</strong> Sleep helps support healthy brain
            function. While you're sleeping, your brain is preparing for the
            next day. It's forming new pathways to help you learn and remember
            information. Sleep deficiency alters activity in some parts of the
            brain, which may cause problems with decision making,
            problem-solving, controlling emotions and behavior, and coping with
            change.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Emotional Well-being:</strong> Sleep deficiency can make you
            feel tired and moody, and you may feel down or depressed. It can
            also affect your ability to interact with others.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Performance and Safety:</strong> Getting enough sleep helps
            you function well throughout the day. People who are sleep deficient
            are less productive at work and school. They take longer to finish
            tasks, have a slower reaction time, and make more mistakes. Lack of
            sleep also contributes to road accidents.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Growth and Development:</strong> Deep sleep triggers the
            body to release the hormone that promotes normal growth in children
            and teens. This hormone also boosts muscle mass and helps repair
            cells and tissues in children, teens, and adults.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Immune System:</strong> Sleep plays a role in your body’s
            immune system. Ongoing sleep deficiency can change the way in which
            your immune system responds. For example, if you're sleep deficient,
            you may have trouble fighting common infections.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          In summary, adequate sleep is a key part of a healthy lifestyle, and
          can benefit your heart, weight, mind, and more.

        <h2>2. How to improve your sleep</h2>

        <p>
          Below is a list of ways to get better sleep. Remember, time is of zero
          importance. If the sleep is not quality and the body cannot repair and
          perform the functions it needs to, it is as good as not sleeping at
          all. The below list is advice from medical professionals and results
          of personal experimentation and experience.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>No caffeine:</strong>
            Do not drink caffeine less than 8 or so hours before sleep. This
            will destroy deep sleep as well as REM. When I drink it less than
            about 6-8 hours before bed, my sleep is a roller coaster for hours.
            Even if you fall asleep at first, you may wake up later and it will
            definitely affect quality overall.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No alcohol:</strong>
            Do not drink alcohol any time near bedtime. It may help you “fall”
            asleep, but you will likely wake up shortly after. Regardless of
            what sleep you “think you got”, it interrupts the most important
            which is deep sleep. Avoid at all costs. It also has next to zero
            health benefits so if you are serious about good health, you will
            never drink again, even on special occasions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Darkness:</strong> Make room cave dark. Zero light, zero
            LEDs, zero chance of ANY light until you wake up. Blue light
            supposedly has twice the effect as yellow light in producing
            cortosol, the hormone that wakes you up. Blue light cut and lower
            lighting will then likely halve the cortosol production in the
            evening and aid good sleep.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Coldness:</strong>
            Make room cold. A warm room will prevent falling asleep and you will
            not get all of the benefits of sleep and may wake you up in the
            middle of the night. The colder the better, just add more blankets.
            It will cost more in electric, but good health is worth it. Lowering
            skin temp by 1 degree helped many insomniacs even to be cured
            supposedly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Avoid EMFs:</strong>
            All electronics and outlets that are active etc. 6-8 feet away. No
            cellphone anywhere near bed or pillow. EMF messes with your brain
            waves which are also what controls sleep.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mattress:</strong>
            Get a mattress that conforms YOU to your correct posture. Not a
            mattress that conforms to your (most likely) BAD posture. This will
            just make you worse. I sleep on 2x 1" foam mattresses on a hard wood
            frame. This means 1 mattress for life with no sagging and no poor
            posture.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pillow:</strong>
            Get a pillow that conforms YOUR NECK to your correct posture. Not a
            pillow that conforms to your (most likely) BAD posture. This will
            just make you worse.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Nuetral joints:</strong>
            Sleep face up in a neutral spine if you can. If you do not have a
            neutral spine, your discs will not recover (at night is their best
            chance to recover) and you will MOST LIKELY get worse. This goes the
            same for all joints. Of course you may side sleep or roll over etc.,
            but as long as your joints are allowed to be nuetral for a decent
            period of time, healing can take place and it will help prevent
            cramps and muscle imbalance in the morning.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Stop eating:</strong>
            Try not to eat just before bed. Digestion also produces heat which
            raises body temp. Higher body temps prevent good sleep.It also uses
            energy that could be rerouted to healing. It can also lead to poor
            digestion/health because you have things being only partially broken
            down entering areas that they should not. Never a good idea. People
            say 3 hours, but I have found for my diet 4-5 hours or more is best.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Track sleep:</strong>
            Track your sleep and do self-experimentation to find out what gives
            you better deep sleep. Fitbit is one of the best on the market for
            sleep tracking accuracy at a low price, but they steal personal info
            and two of mine bricked due to poor software so I do not recommend
            them to anyone.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Parasympathetic breathing:</strong>
            Breath out longer than in if you are having trouble sleeping. This
            will trigger the parasympathetic nervous system and forcibly calm
            you down, reduce stress, and should also help get you more tired.
            The reason this may work is that most people live in sympathetic
            (stress) mode and need to calm down.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Clean sinuses:</strong>
            Clean out your sinuses before attempting to sleep to ensure you can
            sleep as long as possible before possibly becoming stuffy again. See
            breathing section on how to instantly clear sinuses anywhere,
            anytime.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tongue exercise:</strong>
            Do tongue exercises to increase tongue strength. If your tongue is
            flabby/has loose skin, it will fall to the back of your throat more
            easily which will block or hinder your breathing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Face exercise</strong>
            Do lip and cheek exercises. Certain facial muscles that are weak
            will get pulled by their agonists causing tightness on certain sinus
            passages. This will hinder airflow and adversely affect your sleep.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Avoid supplements and pills:</strong>
            Do not take any sleeping supplements. Doing this may upset the
            balance internally, not go together with your circadian rhythm, and
            your body may have a degraded ability to produce its own melatonin
            (use it or lose it).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Get sunlight and D3:</strong>
            Get enough sunlight, especially near infrared radiation triggers
            mitochondrial production of melatonin which cools down the which
            cools you down too. Additionally, the dermus produces vitamin D3
            which has so many health benefits. The sunlight not only does that,
            but also helps set a normal circadian rhythm for better sleep.
          </li>
