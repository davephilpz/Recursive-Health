        <h2>1. What is box breathing?</h2>

        <p>
          Box breathing, also known as square breathing, is a simple and
          effective technique for managing stress and improving concentration.
          It involves a specific pattern of inhalation, holding the breath,
          exhalation, and holding the breath again, each for an equal count.
        </p>

        <h3>How to perform box breathing:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong> Inhale: </strong> Breathe in slowly and deeply through your
            nose, counting to four quietly in your mind. Try to fill your lungs
            completely.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hold: </strong> Hold your breath on the inhale for another
            count of four.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Exhale: </strong> Slowly exhale through your mouth for a
            count of four, trying to expel all the air from your lungs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hold Again: </strong> Hold your breath again on the exhale
            for a count of four before inhaling again.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>2. Benfits of box breathing</h2>

        <p>
          Box breathing, with its structured pattern of deep breathing, offers
          several benefits, especially in terms of stress management,
          relaxation, and mental clarity.
        </p>

        <h3>Key benefits of the box breathing method:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Stress Reduction: </strong> Box breathing is particularly
            effective at reducing stress. By focusing on the breath, it helps to
            calm the nervous system, lowering stress hormones like cortisol, and
            promoting a state of calm.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Improved Focus and Concentration: </strong> The practice
            requires concentration on the breathing pattern, which can help in
            sharpening focus and attention. This is beneficial in scenarios that
            require high levels of concentration, such as studying, working, or
            performing tasks that require mental clarity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Enhanced Emotional Regulation: </strong> Regular practice of
            box breathing can help in regulating emotions. It's especially
            helpful in managing anxiety, anger, or frustration, promoting a more
            balanced emotional state.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Increased Mindfulness: </strong> The technique encourages
            mindfulness, as it requires one to be fully present and attentive to
            the rhythm of their breathing. This can improve overall awareness
            and presence in daily activities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Better Sleep: </strong> Box breathing can be a useful tool
            for those struggling with sleep issues. The relaxation effect
            achieved through the practice can help in falling asleep faster and
            achieving a deeper, more restful sleep.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lower Blood Pressure: </strong> The deep, rhythmic breathing
            involved in box breathing can help in lowering blood pressure, which
            is beneficial for cardiovascular health.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Improved Lung Function: </strong> Regular practice can
            strengthen the lungs and improve overall respiratory efficiency,
            which is beneficial for physical activities and overall health.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Helps in Panic Situations: </strong> For those prone to
            panic attacks or acute stress reactions, box breathing can be an
            effective technique to regain control over breathing and reduce the
            intensity of the panic.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          This cycle is typically repeated for three to four rounds.
          Practitioners of the method report feelings of euphoria, calm, and
          increased tolerance to cold temperatures after performing these
          breathing exercises.

        <h2>4. What I have learned</h2>

        <p>
          Having used this breathing method for several years now, I have
          applied it in several situations and gotten some good results.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Focus: </strong>Focusing on the rhythm coupled with the
            balancing of O<sub>2</sub> and Co<sub>2</sub> gives me hightened
            concentration on any task. It helps to balance the sympathetic and
            parasympathetic (vagus nerve) nervous systems. I use it when I am in
            the shower and turn the temperature all the way down for a cold
            shock.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Vision: </strong> Changes your focus to a semi-relaxed
            state. I notice sometimes when driving and straining my eyes or
            upset because of selfish drivers. This take my eyes to a moderate
            state and focus more on the overall surroundings. This is again, the
            parasympathetic nervous system at work or the sympathetic if you are
            too calm.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Better breathing: </strong> Enhances breathing ability after
            even a minute or so of practice for minutes or even hours
            afterwards. By enchanced breathing, I mean less congestion and
            subconscious deeper and slower nose breathing.
          </li>
        </ol>
