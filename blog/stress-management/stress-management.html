        <h2>1. What is stress anyways?</h2>

        <p>
          When people hear stress, they automatically think about their job,
          relationship, money situation or other such things. This is however
          just mental stress, and is only the tip of the iceberg. Mental stress
          can manifest into physical stress as hormones and other chemicals
          released in the brain controls functions throughout the body.
        </p>

        <p>
          Stress comes in many shapes and forms and is by no means limited to
          just mental stress. Our environment, situation, lifestyle choices,
          relationships and more can also cause either physical or mental stress
          on our bodies.
        </p>

        <p>
          This all sounds really horrible, but there is light at the end of the
          tunnel. There are positive stressors known as hormesis and we will
          breakdown the types as well as list out positive and negative
          stressors.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="blog-section" id="centerpiece-2">
        <h2>2. Positive vs. negative stress: What is the difference?</h2>

        <p>
          Stress is all bad for your health, right? Yes and no. While all stress
          causes damage to your body, some if it can trigger natural defenses in
          your body. Your body takes this stress stimulus and becomes stronger
          due to this. This is called hormesis and these are
          <strong>positive stressors</strong> . The most well known form of
          hormesis is probably exercise. Lift a weight and become stronger, run
          and gain more endurance, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are <strong>negative stressors</strong> too that only cause harm
          to your body with little to no benefits; in other words, you will lose
          more than you gain. These include things like cigarette smoke, a
          polluted environment, processed foods, too much sugar, poor
          relationships, a rough job environment etc.
        </p>

        <h3>Managing stress</h3>

        <p>
          Too much stress is bad, even if it is a positive stressor and
          therefore stress management is paramount.
        </p>

        <p>
          How do you manage stress? The answer is simple, eliminate all negative
          stressors and balance positive stressors with ample rest and recovery.
          Sounds simple, right? Some stresses may be out of your control and
          there are ways in the breathing section to forcefully calm your body,
          but for all of the rest, you are in full control.
        </p>

        <h3>Chronic vs. acute stress</h3>

        <p>
          <strong>Chronic stress</strong>
          is at the root of most diseases also known as lifestyle illnesses. A
          lifestyle illness is something caused 100% by a person's lifestyle
          choices and has nothing to do with genetics. Many experts say that
          80-90% of all disease is due to poor lifestyle choices. This is both
          good and bad news. Good in that you can easily stop it, and bad in
          that some habits are not so easily broken. A chronic stress means that
          there is no period of healing for the body to perform its job and
          repair. Any type of chronic stress should be avoided at all costs.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Acute stress</strong> is a stress that is situational and
          happens based on the environment such as extreme hot or cold, or is a
          personal choice. As long as acute stress such as exercise is
          accompanied by ample rest and recovery, you will be stronger than you
          were before. the old saying: "what doesn't kill you makes you
          stronger" couldn't be more true.

          3. 10 Types of negative stressors (anti-hormesis) with a net loss
        </h2>

        <p>
          The following list of 10 types of anti-hormesis should be avoided if
          possible as they will not provide any benefit or boost your health
          even if done in moderation and with proper rest and recovery. Small
          doses of them may provide some benefit, but it has yet to be proven by
          science. Will make future updates if I see any findings in medical
          journals etc.
